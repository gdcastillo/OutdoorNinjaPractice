State container: a collection of all the data inside the app (that's what redux is)

Views controlled by react, data controlled by redux

Knowing how to design your state is essential in Redux

A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state
	-an application can have many different "pieces of state"


App state is not connected at all to component state

container: a react component that has a direct connection to the state (defined by redux)
	-which component to make a container? 
		-the whole app doesn't care about the book list or book detail, it just renders that to the page.
		-bookList and bookDetail should be containers 

container vs component, good to know


actions, action creators
	-actions: most things starts as an event triggered by a user
	-action creator: a function that returns an action; whenever a button is clicked, it'll call an action creator, which will return an object

using a good amount of bootstrap

using this. in a callback is wrong
	-use bind(this) in the constructor to fix this

middleware: a function that takes in an action and depending on the action's type/payload, it can let it pass through, manipulate it, stop it, console.log it, all kinds of stuff BEFORE it reaches the reducers
	-they're like gatekeepers

payload: optional property that goes along with actions that can contain some additional data that describes that particular action
